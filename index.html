	   <h1>Candies and Who Likes Them</h1>   
	   <body>
		Bellow are two visualizations that display candy and who likes the different kinds. The first is a heatmap that adds up the total popularity of a selected candy for each individual state. The popularity is then put into a range from 0.0 to 1.0, where 0.0 is no one liked it and 1.0 is everyone enjoyed it. The second is a scatter plot that shows the total 'joy' values and the average age of who enjoys that candy. To use the map, you need to select a candy from the scatter plot below. Hovering over the points on the scatter plot will display their individual information to the right of the scatter plot.
